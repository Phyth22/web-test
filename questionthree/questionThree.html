    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph. It contains some random text to demonstrate how external CSS can be used to style it.</p>
    <p>Hereâ€™s another paragraph with some more random text. The styling will make the text size 16 pixels, and the line height will ensure readability.</p>
    <p>Finally, this is the third paragraph with even more random text. The color of the text will be a dark grey to give it a soft look.</p>
